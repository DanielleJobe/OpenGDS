How to get started:
You need to clone the Repository into your LabVIEW20XX folder (currently the Master branch is in LabVIEW2014)
To do this you can clone it into a temporary directory and then copy this into the LabVIEW-folder.
In Windows:
 git clone https://github.com/opengds/OpenGDS.git c:\LabVIEW2014-temp
 xcopy C:\labview2014-temp C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2014 /H /Y /R /S
