[UML_Tip2]
en= You connect a class in the class diagram to a LabVIEW lvclass by specifying the class path to the file. After that you can right click on the class to synchronize the code or the UML diagram.

[UML_Tip3]
en=When a class node is connected to a real class (using the class path), you can view the VI method in the context help dialog by pointing the mouse on a method and press Shift-key.

[UML_Tip4]
en=When a class node is connected to a real class (using the class path), you can open the VI method by pressing Ctrl while double clicking on it.

[UML_Tip5]
en=One VERY useful feature is to view detailed information about a relationship.\0AAfter you have done a reverse engineering of your classes you can place the mouse over a relationship between 2 classes and press Shift, to see what causes this relationship.

[UML_Tip6]
en=Nodes can be moved using the arrow keys, and by holding the shift key down the object will be move 5 times longer.

[UML_Tip7]
en=Type Def controls can also be created and synchronized. To create a Type Def add a class node on the class diagram. Open its properties and select stereotype <<TYPE>>, <<ENUM>>. You can then also select if this control should belong to a particular class.

[UML_Tip8]
en=You can connect a class to a package by creating a new class inside a package or by dragging a class over the package and open the class node properties.\0AYou can then select connect to package. To disconnect a class from a package you open the class properties and click disconnect class from package.

[UML_Tip9]
en=By pressing Space-key, the selection tool becomes active.
